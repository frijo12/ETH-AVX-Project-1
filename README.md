# PrimeCheck Solidity Contract

## Overview

The PrimeCheck contract is a Solidity smart contract designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It offers functionality to determine whether a given number is prime. The contract includes methods to require a number to be prime, revert transactions if a number is not prime, and assert the primality of a predefined number.

## Features

- **Check Primality:** Users can input a number to check if it is prime.
- **Revert If Not Prime:** Functionality to revert the transaction if the number is not prime, conserving gas for the caller.
- **Require Prime:** A method that mandates a number to be prime; otherwise, it throws an error.
- **Assert Prime:** Demonstrates the use of `assert` in Solidity for internal checks by asserting the primality of a predefined number in the contract.

## Functions

### `testRequireIsPrime(uint _num)`

- **Description:** Checks if the input number is prime. If the number is not prime, it throws an error message "Number is not prime".
- **Parameters:**
  - `_num`: The number to check for primality.
- **Returns:** A string message confirming the number is prime.

### `testRevertIfNotPrime(uint _num)`

- **Description:** Checks if the input number is prime. If the number is not prime, it reverts the transaction.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_num`: The number to check for primality.
- **Returns:** A string message confirming the number is prime.

### `_isPrime(uint _num)`

- **Description:** Internal function to check if a number is prime.
- **Parameters:**
  - `_num`: The number to check for primality.
- **Returns:** A boolean indicating if the number is prime.

### `testAssertIsPrime()`

- **Description:** Asserts that a predefined number in the contract is prime.
- **Returns:** A string message confirming the predefined number is prime.

## How to Deploy

1. **Install Truffle:** Ensure that Truffle is installed on your machine. If not, install it using npm:
   ```
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate into the cloned repository and install the required npm packages.
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Compile the Contract:** Compile the Solidity contract.
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

5. **Deploy:** Deploy the contract to your desired network using Truffle.
   ```
   truffle migrate --network <network-name>
   ```

## Testing

To test the functionality of the PrimeCheck contract, you can utilize Truffle's built-in testing framework. Write your tests in JavaScript or Solidity and place them in the `test` folder of your project.
